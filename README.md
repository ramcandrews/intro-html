## I will start commiting code from one of my websites

## Trippy Perlin
The background fill on this website is a javascript visualization. It is drawn in a canvas element. All of the javascript is inline. Inline javascript is supposed to streamline pageload times by eleminating extra page load requets. Two scripts are embedded in the HTML. In the <HEAD> tag, is the original perlin script, it is called on by the trippy perlin script embedded at the end of the HTML file. I am still playing around with the parameters to make it looks just right.
  
In the future I would like to have it match/mimic some deep learning algorithms.
